# City Weather App

This Github repository contains the code for the [City Weather App](http://www.cityweatherapp.com) website. [City Weather App](http://www.cityweatherapp.com) lets users find the cities that match their personal weather preferences. After entering information about their preferred weather, the site searches data on nearly 4000 NOAA weather stations to find the locations that match the user's preferred weather.
