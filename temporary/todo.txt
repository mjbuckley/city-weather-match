*. I changed weather.json so that metro areas now include their state ("Columbus, OH"). This helps to distinguish between different areas of the same name.  Things appear to still be working ok, but double check. Be sure to use this new feature to be sure I actually am distinuishing areas of the same name.
* I added metromap.json which maps the metro areas to their cities to their stations. Will be useful on the metroarea page. Use if to make links.

0. I have been testing param checking in the results component. Once I get this working I need to apply it everywhere.
0. Why does my results component seem to be rendering twice? When I put console.log(this.props.matches) in the render function in logs twice on most loads, once with the previous value and once with the current value. Not sure?
0. Right now my param checks work, but they assume valid params and values for all weather options. Be able to deal with invalid stuff and with partial weather values (say they don't care about precip but all other values present).
0. I made a buildLink function to build links. It works, but should right now I pass it all props. Is there a none verbose way to only pass it some props.  Does it even matter?
0. Get metro area page link to cities working.

0. Deal with spaces in city and meto area names. I think this is mostly done, but double check.
0. Can/should I extract the link building in to a function?
1. On the search page I can probably make the separate range input even handlers into one function.
3. I have a clicked state I'm not currently using. I think it will be useful, but decide and remove if not.
4. I think I have added query params to all pages, but I haven't thought through if I'm adding the correct thing (props passed down from state or something else). After that, start working on function to read the query params and do what needs to be done from there.
6. Should I make a city to station map? Would probably be useful for the metro areas page, and maybe somewhere else.
7. City links on mertro-areas/:metroarea page are still set to fake. See #6 for a fix.
8. Need to add in link (where needed) on station page to city disambiguation page.
7. Might look in to Lodash function memoization. This might be a replacement for what I'm trying to do with looking at query params and deciding if I need to update state. Also, look into Lodash in general.
8. I can probably simplify the way I'm passing props in some places. Instead of explicitly sending things there are probably some better ways (spread operator?).


NOTES

1. Do I need a json loader? What I'm doing (require) seems to be working fine, but I've seen references to needing one with webpack (version 1, not version 2, but I think create-react-app uses v.1 right now). Lots of stuff is hidden with create-react-app, so maybe some sort of loader is already included? Also, I've seen suggestions that it's better to load with webpack. Not 100% sure why, but worth looking in to. Keep all this in mind if anything weird starts happening/figure out why webpack might be a better solution.
